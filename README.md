## Description

Breakout style game to demonstrate particle effects and collision detection.

## Features and Implementation

### Canvas Rendering and Object Collision

Game is rendered in canvas, including the game view, paddle, ball, and bricks.
Collision is tracked on the ball and bricks. The ball tracks contact with the screen edges and paddle, while the bricks track contact with the ball individually.

### Effects

Current effects are oriented towards full screen collision display, hence the temporary SiezureBall title. These are for demo purposes only and will be replaced with particle effects on collision.
